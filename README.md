# Weekly-Budget-Project
Budget Application using JavaScript
This is a simple web application built using HTML, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript.
It is a budget simulator that tracks all the spending and available balance after an initial budget has been inputed.
It notifies when half of your budget has been spent, and also when 70% of your bugdet has been spent. 
I hope you have as much fun using this as I did while building.
